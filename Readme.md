## NEW LEARNINGS

1. Learned to integrate firebase oauth

3. Using GSAP animations ( however only usage but i learned to use them )

## Topics Revised

- SCSS mixin, partials, variables
- Responsive Design
- Figma Desiging
- Using Vanilla Js

## Difficuilties Faced

During the developement, I realised the importance of understanding asynchronous behaviour of javascript ( I marked to it learn more about it ). 
Seting up the Authentication was the most enjoyable part of this project. Now I am plannin to work on a new big project with more advanced firebase usages.
